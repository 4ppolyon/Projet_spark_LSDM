Question 2 :
What is the percentage of computational power lost due to maintenance?

Loading machine_events
Data Loaded 37780 rows

Filtering relevant events (add = 0, remove = 1)
Mapping data to associate events to each machine
Sorting by machine and timestamp
Calculating time losses for each machine
Calculating total power lost and total power (multiplying the time lost by the CPU capacity)
Percentage of computational power lost due to maintenance :  2.19 %

Execution Time : 0.23 s
